## Installation

### CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. You can install it with the following command:

```bash
$ gem install cocoapods
```

> CocoaPods 1.1+ is required to build ItemsDataSource.

To integrate ItemsDataSource into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '10.0'
use_frameworks!

target '<Your Target Name>' do
    pod 'ItemsDataSource'
end
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```

### Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks.

You can install Carthage with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) using the following command:

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```

To integrate ItemsDataSource into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "ItemsDataSource" 
```

Run `carthage update` to build the framework and drag the built `ItemsDataSource.framework` into your Xcode project.

### Swift Package Manager

The [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) is a tool for automating the distribution of Swift code and is integrated into the `swift` compiler. It is in early development, but ItemsDataSource does support its use on supported platforms. 

Once you have your Swift package set up, adding ItemsDataSource as a dependency is as easy as adding it to the `dependencies` value of your `Package.swift`.


#### Swift 4

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/minikin/ItemsDataSource.git")
]
```

### Manually

If you prefer not to use any of the aforementioned dependency managers, you can integrate ItemsDataSource into your project manually.
Just copy files from `Sources` folder to your projects:
```
CellDescriptor.swift
Groupable.swift
Itemable.swift
ItemsDataSource.swift
SupplementaryDescriptor.swift
```
